To keep the challenge interesting, I linked against the libc in this folder.

! To execute this binary, copy this command:

```
LD_PRELOAD=./libc.so.6 ./ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ./02_demo_64_bit
```

! For this challenge you need to use vmmap for the libc base address

to run the program with gdb:

> gdb ./ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
> gdb-peda$ --library-path ./ ./02_demo_64_bit

you can set breakpoints or break the program with ctrl+c like before.
